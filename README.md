# Customer Churn Analysis Using Power BI and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing and predicting customer churn using historical data. It combines data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and Power BI visualizations to help businesses retain valuable customers by identifying those most likely to leave.

##  Goals
- Understand customer churn patterns using data.
- Predict which customers are likely to churn.
- Visualize key metrics using interactive Power BI dashboards.
- Enable data-driven decision-making for retention strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL (for ETL and transformation)

##  ML Techniques
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree & Random Forest
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)

##  Power BI Dashboard
Includes:
- Churn Rate
- Customer Demographics
- Account & Service Usage
- New Joiners vs Churners

## ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard

The `Churn_Analysis.pbix` file located in the `powerbi-dashboard/` folder presents an interactive visual analysis of customer churn patterns.

### Key Features:
- **Executive Summary:** Overview of total customers, churn rate, new joiners.
- **Demographic Insights:** Churn analysis by gender, age groups, and marital status.
- **Account & Payment Info:** Insights based on tenure, contracts, payment methods.
- **Geographic Breakdown:** Churn distribution across top states.
- **Service Usage:** Churn rate by services like streaming, internet type, and more.
- **Churn Prediction Page:** Displays predicted churners based on machine learning results.
